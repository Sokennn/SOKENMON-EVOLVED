		#This is intended to be used for configuring the shown placeholders, but can include text/formatting. Text changes should be made via lang entries!
		#Wrap "{}" around text shown when crouching, and "!{}" for text shown when not crouching.
		#Placeholders prefixed by "%" have a lang entry at "cobblemonintegrations.jade.pokemon_entity.<placeholder without %>".
		#Placeholders prefixed by "#" MUST be placed on their own line.
		#Valid placeholders are: %dex_status, %display_name, %nickname, %species, %gender, #health, %level, %typing, %ev_yield, %nature, %ability, %ivs, %evs, %trainer, %egg_groups, %battle_message
		#Any text prefixed with "$" will look for an associated lang entry. Example: "$crouch_message" pulls the lang entry "cobblemonintegrations.jade.pokemon_entity.crouch_message".
		#Finally, you can configure conditions using "<placeholder>:<conditions>" where conditions are an & separated list of "<hidden/unknown>_<when/unless>_<condition>".
		#Valid conditions are: unknown, encountered, caught, wild, yours, others, nicknamed
